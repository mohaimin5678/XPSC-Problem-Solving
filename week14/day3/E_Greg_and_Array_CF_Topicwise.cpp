/*
Here its a different type of "difference array" 
first they want us to perform M operations & then we 
need to do those operation K times where they'll give us
operation range!

Observation: We don't need to do M operation initially!
Lets store it first & then we'll check how many times
these operations we'll need to do. (On K queries)

Explanation: 
i) we initialize the vector & keep that as it is. 
ii) We made a pair<pair<int,int>,ll> vector to store the operations. 
    We did it with indexing because it will be needed. 
iii) We took another vector S to calculate the operations which 
    is given on K queries. We did the difference array concept 
    on this. After doing s[x]++ & s[y+1]--. We took the prefix 
    sum & by that now we can understand how many times we'll do 
    each operation. 
iv) Now that we know how many times we'll perform a particular 
    operation, we can simply do (d Ã— times), which will make d 
    the same as if we had performed the operation that many times 
    separately.
v) Now we took a vector op to perform the operations using
   the difference array concept & after doing the operations we
   we'll calculate the prefix sum. 
vi) finally we'll add them with the initial vector v & that will
    the final answer.

testcase: 
3 3 3
1 2 3
1 2 1
1 3 2
2 3 4
1 2
1 3
2 3

v=[1 2 3]

store=[{{1 2},1}, {{1 3},2}, {{2 3},4}]
now K queries:- 
0 1  2  3  4
  1    -1
  1       -1
     1    -1
--------------
0 2  3  2 0    -->prefix sum
operations contribution which is s. so s=[2 3 2]

now lets change d's value on store vector using s. 
(store[i].second)*=s[i];
now store=[{{1 2},2}, {{1 3},6}, {{2 3},8}]

lets take op vector to do the operations: 
0 1  2  3  4
  2    -2
  6       -6
     8    -8
------------
0 8 16 14  0
so ans=[8 16 14]
     v=[1  2  3]
       ---------
     v=[9 18 17]    final answer
